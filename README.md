#Running in the USA

Simple python script that parses the table at http://runningintheusa.com/Race/Statistics.aspx and converts it to CSV file.

## Installation

```
$ pip install beautifulsoup4 
```

Since we want things to be fast, we use lxml as the html parser

```
$ pip install lxml
```

## Output

All the output csv files are stored under [output](https://github.com/varunmehta/running-in-the-usa/tree/master/output) folder.
